# Portfolio
Hi, welcome to my portfolio. 

I am sharing in this repository all my public projects and notebooks to show my knowledge. Also, feel free to use the notebooks in your own code.

This is a Data Science portfolio. I am searching for my first Data Science position.

In the file "CurriculumVitaeFabioCardosoPasquini.pdf", you can find my curriculum with my full experience.

Hope you find useful information.

Best regards,
Fabio.
